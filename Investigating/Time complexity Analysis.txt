Task0:
  Worst case Time complexity : O(1)
  Reason : Array element access using index is O(1) complexity.
  
Task1:
  Worst case Time complexity : O(n)
  Reason: 2 separate 'for' loops iterating over every element in each row.Adding element to a set is O(1) operation.
 
Task2:
  Worst case Time complexity : O(n)
  Reason: 2 separate 'for' loops iterating over every element in each row.Adding values is a O(1) operation
  
Task3:
  Worst case Time complexity : O(nlogn)
  Reason: 2 separate 'for' loops going over every element in each row is O(n) but sorting a list is an O(nlogn) operation.Adding element to a set is O(1) operation.

Task4:
  Worst case Time complexity : O(nlogn)
  Reason: 4 separate 'for' loops going over every element in each row is O(n) but sorting a list is an O(nlogn) operation.Adding element to a set is O(1) operation.
